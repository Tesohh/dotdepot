# ðŸ“¦ Dotdepot
Dotdepot is a simple utility, written in Go, to manage your dotfiles across multiple computers and OSes and take the pain out of keeping your config up to date on all your machines.

## Can't i just use git?
Yes, you can, but it only works well if you have all machines running the same os.
For example, VSCode saves it's config in a different folder for each OS.
Plus, as a bonus, you can configure dotdepot to run a installation script after pulling all your files.

## Installing
* With go: `go install github.com/Tesohh/dotdepot`

## After installing
1. Create a `~/.config/dotdepot` folder
2. Add the two files:
    * `login.yml`
    * `config.yml`
3. Fill out login.yml:
```yml
username: <yourUsername>
password: <yourPassword> # if you want to just pull, you don't need the password
```

4. Fill out config.yml (see [configuration](#configuration))

## Configuration
> Note: if you want to just pull, you can leave `config.yml` empty.

Here's an example config.yml:
```yml
files:
    - macos: ~/.vimrc
    linux: ~/.vimrc
    # windows is ignored because i didn't specify it
    
    - macos: ~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json
    linux: ~/.config/Code/settings.json
    windows: "%APPDATA%/Code/User/settings.json"
    # if it has special characters like %, wrap in quotes
    # also notice how i didn't use backslash. 
```
